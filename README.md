# Conway's Game of Life

This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life. The app is built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). This project is used as a learning ground for the Svelte framework.

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

All new ideas, enhancements, and bugs are specified and discussed using GitHub issues.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
